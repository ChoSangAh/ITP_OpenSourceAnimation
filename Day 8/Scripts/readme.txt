
Thank you for downloading this script : DeCasteljauBezierCurve.jsx - Version : 1.0


Description :

This script creates an After Effects composition taking the principle of the technique
found by Paul de Casteljau to draw a Bezier curve.

The user interface is created with Flash Builder allowing a representation of
the Bezier curve before constructing the After Effects composition.

Overall this project allows using the communication possibilities between ActionScript
and ExtendScript, which is very interesting and opens more possibilities for scripting.

This script is more of an academic exercise than a script that has actual production purpose.

The usefulness of this type of script is to understand the extensive scripting thanks
to new interface possibilities not possible only with the ExtendScript tools and made possible
with Adobe Flash Builder with the ExternalInterface object and its call method that let's create
communication between swf file and ScriptUI.
